Function 80313a78
^^ This function calculates what word in the RAM offset table is for the current difficulty
^3a78 -> r5 = 0

^3a7c-3a84 -> Go to 3a90 if 8th bit of r4 is zero
^^ I think 8th bit means Master Extra
^3a88-3a8c -> r3 = 7 and go to 3ad4

^3a90-3a98 -> Go to 3aa4 if 27th bit is zero
^^ Master is 27th bit?
^3a9c-3aa0 -> r3 = 6 and go to 3ad4

^3aa4-3aac -> Go to 3ab4 if 28th bit is zero
^^ 28th bit indicates Extra
^3ab0 -> r5 = 3

^3ab4-3ab8 -> r4 = 805D4914
^3abc-3ac4 -> Go to 3acc if word at 805D4914 is zero
^3ac8 -> r5 = 9
^^ That should be the number of the unused difficulty
^^ Later code seems to suggest multiple unused difficulties

^3acc -> r5 = r5 + r3
^3ad0 -> r3 = r5
^3ad4 -> blr

^ This function turns the difficulty into a number so that 0x8047b4ec + 4*a contains a pointer to the first entry of difficulty
^ It turns your difficulty to an offset of the cm difficulty list
^ Input:
^^ r3 is a number indicating Beginner, Advanced, or Expert (Master will be zero)
^^ r4 is a bit field containing whether we are in Extra stages, Master, or in Master Extra
^ Output: r3 is the offset
Note: It uses registers r0, r3, r4, r5
