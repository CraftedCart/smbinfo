808f629c-808f62a8 wrote bits 8, 25


Function 80902754 (in selngc) has a few important things 
809028a8-28b0 stores the current value
809028d4-809028e0 removes the 8th, 27th, 28th bits

Function 808f8d9c (loaded when playing game)
Instruction 808f8e48 sets the Extra bit (28th bit) 
^ After beating Beginner, Advanced, Expert
Instruction 808f8e20-8e24 sets Master bit (27th bit)
Instruction 808f8df4-8df8 sets Master Extra bit (8th bit)

Function 808f5bc4
Instructions 808f62a0-62a4 sets 11th bit and 25th bit
^ Called after beating Beginner Extra and Advanced Extra and every difficulty
Instruction 61bc reads Extra bit

Address 8054df28 also stores diff indicator value (Byte)

21st bit means we didn't enter goal?
22nd bit means credits or something? 
29th bit is main menu? Or complete difficulty


Master bit set again when we complete Master 
Extra bit set again when we complete Expert Extra and Master


6184 checks something too

61b4-61dc seems to check whether we have beaten Expert Extra
Replace 61d8 with 0x2C000000 to see if that sends us to Master at the end of Beginner
No!

808f61d8 is 21f8 in main_game REL

Uhh, check to see more interactions with diff ind value

Read/writes for bit field
8033a7b4-a7b8 checks Master bit
8033061c/3c (function 803305ec) check Master Extra bit and Master bit respectively


The functions
808f8d9c -> Changes the difficulty indicators
808f5bc4 -> Whether we go to another course
803305ec -> Whether to display Go to Extra/Master/Master extra stage


Note that we now have the 6th bit indicate Ultimate Mode


Function 803dc5b0 references byte at 0x0000 in the struct 804c3f70 points to
Function 803dc598 sets byte at 0x0000 in struct to 1
That byte tells us whether or not we unlocked Master


6th bit stores whether or not we selected Master from the menu

Can change text to say Ultimate. It's at 2265f8 in main loop. We have space!

Also at 241f44, but not enough space. This one is probably for ranking menu
