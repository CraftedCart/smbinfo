
How about jump distance?

When jump distance data is read...
Not a jump distance slot
80314548 (func 80314308)

Jump distance slot
Same

When I enter a goal on a jump distance slot, it is also read at
803137e0 (8 bytes after jump distance code) (read twice on green and red goal)
At func 80313790

805d4910 stores the jump distance!

Messing with final stage entries
If you change jump distance on last stage entry, we're alright
Doesn't seem to affect things if you change 0102 to 0100

805d4910 holds -1 when we didn't enter goal

805d4910 written at
3378 (Func something) (writes -1)
37c8 (Func 3790) (writes normal jump distance)
37ec (Func 3790) (writes entry jump distance)
3624 (Func 33cc) (writes -1)

80553992 also holds jump distance at some point.
If goal not entered, it holds 0x01?
Written at 35e0, where it gets jump distance of goal entered
Also written at 80297974, where it gets 0x01
Also written at 80003468, where it get mystery value that might clear it?
