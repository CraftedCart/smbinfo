- `8054E076`: One byte representing camera state (1 (dec) = SMB 1 style camera, 75 (dec) = SMB 2 style camera, and there's a lot more (everything from 1 to about 105 - a few are duplicates))

## Difficulty Indicators

If 8th bit of bit field is set, we are in Master Extra

If 27th bit of bit field is set, we are in Master

If 28th bit of bit field is set, we are in the Extra stage of a difficulty

If value is 0, we are in Beginner

If value is 1, Advanced

If value is 2, Expert
